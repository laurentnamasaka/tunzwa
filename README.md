Tunzwa Immunization System

The Tunzwa Immunization System is an innovative Health IT solution that simplifies child immunization management. It leverages technology to help parents and guardians book vaccination appointments based on their availability, with the added option to request house calls for greater convenience. The system also sends automated reminders, customized to the userâ€™s preferences, ensuring vaccinations are completed on time. By securely storing vaccination records and certificates, Tunzwa reduces the risk of losing important health information, preventing missed or double vaccinations.
